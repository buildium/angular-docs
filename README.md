> Publish angular documentation ([ngdoc](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Writing-AngularJS-Documentation))

## Background

Generate static documentation based on the ngdoc flavor of jsdoc.

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
having to look at its code. This is very important. This makes it possible for
you to separate your module's documented interface from its internal
implementation (guts). This is good because it means that you are free to
change the module's internals as long as the interface remains the same.

> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.
